# This is the README for my Compilers Github repo

## Note about this folder structure, it is a little bit different than what was specified
##I thought it would make more sense for each of the repos PA1-PA5 should be here and as I complete the homeworks and commit changes to the folders to reflect that I finished it
###I talked to Sanil about this folder structure and he approved

#To Grade:PA1
##To Grade PA1 tests all you need to do for the tests is to cd in the respective folders (ex. cd PA2) and then run the tests when in that same level of the folder structure
###Same goes for the other tests for PA2-PA5
##For the AVR assembly code, it is in the PA1 folder and once in that level, the commands can just be run
##I am planning to zip the whole thing in a tar file so when when it is unzipped, the folder structure I specified will be there
